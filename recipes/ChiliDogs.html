                    <h3>PREPRATION</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>ONION + GARLIC</strong> (3 min)<p>Cut the onion into small cubes. Warm up the oil in a pan and add the chopped onion. Fry it over medium heat, and after a minute add a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Caramelize the onion for 2 minutes, then add the crushed garlic and fry for 30 seconds.</p></li>
                            <li><strong>SWEET PEPPER + CHILI + CUMIN</strong>(2 min)<p>Put 2 teaspoons of pepper, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin and about 1 teaspoon of ground chili in a pan with onions and garlic – there can also be flakes or fresh chili, add enough to make it spicy, as you like. Fry the spices for a minute.</p></li>
                            <li><strong>FRYING MEAT </strong>(15 min) <p>Add meat to the pan, season with freshly ground pepper, salt and oregano, and add worcester sauce. Shred meat with a wooden spatula and fry the whole on medium heat, stirring from time to time until the meat is slightly browned (about 10 minutes).</p></li>
                            <li><strong>TOMATO PASTE + TOMATOES</strong> (20 min)<p>In the middle of the pan, make an empty circle between meat – in this place add tomato paste and fry it for a while on high heat. Then pour the canned tomatoes. Mix and stew until the tomatoes disintegrate and most of the liquid evaporates – the chili sauce must be very thick so that it does not slide off the hot dogs. It will take about 15 min-20 min. When the sauce is ready, it is worth trying and seasoning if necessary.</p></li>
                        </ol>

                    <h3>SERVING</h3>
                    <p>Put one grilled sausage into the heated rolls. Then put a generous portion of chili sauce on it, sprinkle with grated yellow cheese and pour over mustard. Chilli dog regenerates health thanks to a double portion of meat – several portions will heal even the biggest damage after street shootings. Just remember not to hit the salesman or run over the stand, because he won’t sell you this treat!</p>
