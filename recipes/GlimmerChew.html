                            <h3>Steps</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>JELLY</strong> (5 min + few h)<p>Measure 1/3 of the amount of water given on the jelly packaging (standard it will be about 80 ml – if you make only one portion of dessert, because you only need half a jelly package for the recipe). Bring water to a boil in a pot, then turn off the burner. After a few minutes, add jelly podwer into hot water, mix well until the gelatin dissolves (do not boil!). Then pour the liquid into a flat dish and after cooling, put in the fridge for a few hours (under cover, so that the jelly does not take the smell of other products).</p></li>
                                <li><strong>MELTING CHOCOLATE</strong> (1 min) <p>Pour a glass of water into the pot. Place a metal or glass bowl of similar diameter on the pot, so that the bowl stands on it. Heat the water in the pot until it boils, put the crushed chocolate into the bowl and slowly, stirring, melt the chocolate. When it is liquid, add concentrated milk, stirring vigorously all the time – the mass will quickly thicken and become elastic like toffi. When this happens, turn off the burner and remove the bowl from the pan. Wait for the mass to cool completely.</p></li>
                                <li><strong>DYE</strong></strong> <p>Add blue liquid dye to the mass, mix well. It is possible that white chocolate (in practice, its color is slightly yellowish) in combination with the blue dye will start to turn green – then you need to add much more dye and the color will even out.</p></li>
                                <li><strong>TOPPINGS (1 min)</strong> <p>Take the jelly out of the mold and cut into small cubes. Toss into a completely cooled chocolate-milk mass and mix. For a better visual effect and a varied structure/crunchiness, white-blue sugar sprinkles can also be added to the mass.</p></li>
                                <li><strong>FORMING & CHILLING</strong> (4 h)<p>Put the mass into a square, flat container lined with baking paper. Align the top with a spoon. Cover and put in the fridge for at least a few hours. If you want a harder consistency, you can also keep the mass in the freezer 30 minutes before serving.</p></li>
                                <li><strong>CUTTING INTO CUBES + SPRINKLE</strong> (5 min)<p>Take the cooled mass out of the box and remove the paper. Cut the mass into squares. Mix the fine sugar with citric acid powder in a bowl and coat the pieces evenly in this mixture.</p></li>
