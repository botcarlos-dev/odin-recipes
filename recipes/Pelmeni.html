                <p>DOUGH</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>wheat flour type 450 – 200 g (approx. 1 and 1/3 cup)</li>
                    <li>hot water – 110 ml</li>
                    <li>rapeseed oil – 1 tbsp</li>
                    <li>salt – 1/2 a flat teaspoon</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>FILLING</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>minced pork or pork-beef meat – 250g</li>
                    <li>white onion – 1/2 small piece</li>
                    <li>garlic – 1 small clove</li>
                    <li>black pepper – freshly ground</li>
                    <li>salt – 1/2 tsp</li>
                    <li>cold broth or water mixed with a bit of natural broth spice – 40 ml</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h3>PREPRATION</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>DOUGH</strong> (10 min)<p>Sieve the flour and salt into the bowl. Boil water and mix it with oil, let stand for a minute. Pour water into a bowl with flour and salt, mix thoroughly with a fork. When the dough has cooled down slightly so that it does not burn your hands, keand it into a soft, homogeneous mass for several minutes. If the dough sticks too much, sprinkle it with a small amount of flour. When the dough has the right consistency, cover it with a bowl and set aside for about 20 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><strong>FILLING</strong>(5 min)<p>Chop the minced meat thoroughly. Cut the onion into very small cubes, crush the garlic through the press and add to the meat. Add cold broth, freshly ground pepper and salt. Mix well with your hands – the meat should be very moist, soft and uniform in consistency (to later create a juicy stuffing in the middle of the dumplings).</p></li>
                <li><strong>ROLLING THE DOUGH </strong>(5 min) <p>Lightly sprinkle the countertop with flour. Roll out the dough on it to a thickness of approx. 0.3 cm. It shouldn’t be too thin as there is a risk that the stuffing will flow out. At the same time, it cannot be too thick, because pelmeni will be very hard.</p></li>
                <li><strong>FORMING</strong>(20 min)<p>Cut out the circles from the rolled out dough with a cup/glass. Add a heaped teaspoon of meat stuffing to the center of each. You can brush the sides of the dough (around the stuffing) with water to make them stick together more easily. Glue pelmeni into a semicircle (like standard Polish dumplings), from the center towards the sides. Push the edge of the dough together firmly. Then bend the sides of the dumpling and glue them together, creating something like a croissant-shape dumpling. Put ready pelmeni on the top sprinkled with flour and cover with a cloth so that they do not dry out.</p></li>
                <li><strong>COOKING</strong>(5 min)<p>Boil water in a large pot, add about 1 heaped teaspoon of salt. Put pelmeni in boiling water and gently stir with a wooden spoon, reduce the heat so that the water only gently bubbles. Remember that dumplings should have a lot of space in the pot, so if you have a small pot, cook pelmeni in batches. After the dumplings float to the surface, cook them for 3 minutes. Then transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <h3>SERVING</h3>
            <p>Ready-made pelmeni can be served in several ways – sprinkled with freshly ground pepper with a blcream or a little vinegar, and even in soup. It’s best to put whole pelmieni dumpling in your mouth so that you don’t leave a delicious broth from the inside of the pelmeni on your plate. Mikhail Viktor recommends this Russian specialty made by Mikhail’s Pierogies!
